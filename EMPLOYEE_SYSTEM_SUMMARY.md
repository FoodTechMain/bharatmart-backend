# Employee Management System - Quick Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Three New Models**
- **Employee Model** (`src/models/Employee.ts`)
  - Complete employee information (name, email, phone, DOB, gender, address, join date)
  - Role and department assignment
  - Skills array and performance tracking
  - Status management (Active, On Leave, Resigned, Terminated)
  - Document storage (PAN, Aadhar, Joining Letter)
  - Password authentication with bcrypt
  - Link to User model (optional)

- **Department Model** (`src/models/Department.ts`)
  - Department organization with unique codes
  - Head of department assignment
  - Active status management

- **EmployeeRole Model** (`src/models/EmployeeRole.ts`)
  - Role definitions with permissions
  - Used for dropdown when creating employees

### 2. **Two Complete Route Systems**

#### Employee Routes (`/api/employees`)
- ‚úÖ **Role Management** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE `/roles`)
- ‚úÖ **Employee CRUD** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE `/`)
- ‚úÖ **Document Upload** (POST `/:id/documents`) - Supports PAN, Aadhar, Joining Letter
- ‚úÖ **Document Delete** (DELETE `/:id/documents/:documentType`)
- ‚úÖ **Pagination & Filtering** (by status, department, role)
- ‚úÖ **Search** (by name, email)

#### Department Routes (`/api/departments`)
- ‚úÖ **Department CRUD** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- ‚úÖ **Get Department Employees** (GET `/:id/employees`)
- ‚úÖ **Prevent deletion** if employees are assigned

### 3. **Document Upload System**
- ‚úÖ Local file storage in `uploads/employee-documents/`
- ‚úÖ File validation (PDF, JPG, PNG, DOC, DOCX)
- ‚úÖ 5MB size limit
- ‚úÖ Automatic cleanup on employee deletion
- ‚úÖ Replace old documents when uploading new ones
- üîÑ **Ready for S3 migration** (see documentation)

### 4. **Security Features**
- ‚úÖ Password hashing with bcrypt
- ‚úÖ JWT authentication required
- ‚úÖ Permission-based access control
- ‚úÖ Input validation with express-validator
- ‚úÖ File upload security

### 5. **Integration**
- ‚úÖ Routes added to `server.ts`
- ‚úÖ Upload directory created
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing code

- `employee:read` - View employees
- `employee:create` - Create employees
- `employee:update` - Update employees and upload documents
- `employee:delete` - Delete employees
- `superadmin` - Full access to roles and departments

## üìÇ Files Created/Modified

### Created:
1. `src/models/Employee.ts` - Employee model
2. `src/models/Department.ts` - Department model
3. `src/models/EmployeeRole.ts` - Employee role model
4. `src/routes/Employee.ts` - Employee routes (600+ lines)
5. `src/routes/departments.ts` - Department routes (300+ lines)
6. `uploads/employee-documents/` - Document storage directory
7. `EMPLOYEE_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Complete documentation
8. `EMPLOYEE_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified:
1. `src/server.ts` - Added employee and department routes

## üéØ Key Features

1. **Dropdown Support**: The role field in employee creation can use the EmployeeRole model entries for a dropdown list

2. **Document Management**: 
   - Upload PAN, Aadhar, Joining Letter as files
   - Stored locally in `uploads/employee-documents/`
   - Accessible via `/uploads/employee-documents/{filename}`
   - Easy to migrate to S3 later

3. **Department Organization**:
   - Employees belong to departments
   - Departments have unique codes
   - Can assign head of department
   - Prevents deletion if employees exist

4. **Search & Filter**:
   - Filter by status, department, role
   - Search by name or email
   - Pagination support
   - Sortable results

5. **Security**:
   - Passwords hashed
   - Authentication required
   - Permission checks
   - File validation

## üìã Testing the API

### 1. Create a Role:
```bash
POST /api/employees/roles
{
  "name": "Developer",
  "description": "Software Developer",
  "permissions": ["code:write", "code:review"]
}
```

### 2. Create a Department:
```bash
POST /api/departments
{
  "name": "Engineering",
  "code": "ENG",
  "description": "Engineering Department"
}
```

### 3. Create an Employee:
```bash
POST /api/employees
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phoneNumber": "9876543210",
  "role": "Developer",
  "department": "{department_id}",
  "skills": ["JavaScript", "TypeScript"],
  "status": "Active"
}
```

### 4. Upload Documents:
```bash
POST /api/employees/{employee_id}/documents
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

FormData:
  pan: [file]
  aadhar: [file]
  joiningLetter: [file]
```

## ‚ú® No Breaking Changes

The implementation:
- ‚úÖ Does not modify existing models
- ‚úÖ Does not change existing routes
- ‚úÖ Uses existing authentication middleware
- ‚úÖ Follows project coding patterns
- ‚úÖ Uses existing type definitions
- ‚úÖ Compatible with current database structure
