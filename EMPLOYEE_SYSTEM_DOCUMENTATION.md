  aadhar: [file]
  joiningLetter: [file]
```

### 6. Get Employee Details

## Security Features

1. **Password Hashing**: All employee passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salt rounds of 10
2. **Password Exclusion**: Password field is excluded from query results by default
3. **Authentication Required**: All routes require JWT authentication
4. **Permission-Based Access**: Routes use middleware for permission checks:
   - `employee:read` - View employee data
   - `employee:create` - Create employees
   - `employee:update` - Update employee data
   - `employee:delete` - Delete employees
   - `superadmin` - Full admin access for role/department management
5. **File Upload Security**: 
   - File type validation
   - File size limits (5MB)
   - Unique filenames to prevent conflicts
6. **Input Validation**: express-validator used for all inputs

---

## Document Storage

**Current Implementation**: Local file storage in `uploads/employee-documents/`

**File Naming Convention**: `{fieldname}-{timestamp}-{random}.{ext}`

**Example**: `pan-1729879234567-123456789.pdf`

**Future Enhancement**: The system is designed to be easily upgraded to S3 storage. The document paths are stored as strings, so switching to S3 URLs would only require:
1. Replacing multer with multer-s3
2. Updating the storage configuration
3. Changing file paths to S3 URLs in the database

## Database Relationships

```
User (existing)
  └─> Employee.userId (optional link)

Department
  ├─> Employee.department (many-to-one)
  └─> Department.headOfDepartment -> Employee (one-to-one)

EmployeeRole
  └─> Used for dropdown/reference in Employee.role field
```

---

## Validation Rules

### Employee Creation/Update
- Email: Must be valid and unique
- Phone: Must be 10 digits
- Performance Score: 0-100
- Status: One of ['Active', 'On Leave', 'Resigned', 'Terminated']
- Gender: One of ['Male', 'Female', 'Other']
- Department: Must exist if provided

---

## Integration with Server

The routes have been integrated into `src/server.ts`:

```typescript
import employeeRoutes from './routes/Employee';
import departmentRoutes from './routes/departments';

// ...

app.use('/api/employees', employeeRoutes);
app.use('/api/departments', departmentRoutes);
```

Static file serving is already configured:
```typescript
app.use('/uploads', express.static(path.join(__dirname, '..', 'uploads')));
```

This allows documents to be accessed via:
`http://localhost:PORT/uploads/employee-documents/{filename}`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create employee role
- [ ] Create department
- [ ] Create employee with all fields
- [ ] Upload employee documents
- [ ] Get employee list with pagination
- [ ] Filter employees by department
- [ ] Filter employees by status
- [ ] Search employees by name/email
- [ ] Update employee details
- [ ] Update employee role
- [ ] Delete employee document
- [ ] Delete employee (verify documents deleted)
- [ ] Try to delete department with employees (should fail)
- [ ] Get department with employee count
- [ ] Get all employees in a department
- [ ] Verify password is not returned in responses
- [ ] Test authentication and permissions
- [ ] Test file upload validation (wrong file type)
- [ ] Test file size limit

## Notes

1. **Employee vs User**: Employees are a special type of entity separate from the User model, though they can be linked via `userId` if an employee also needs a user account.

2. **Role Field**: The `Employee.role` field is a string (e.g., "Manager", "Developer") to allow flexibility. The `EmployeeRole` model provides a way to manage predefined roles with permissions.

3. **Documents**: Currently stored locally. S3 integration can be added by:
   - Installing `multer-s3` and `@aws-sdk/client-s3`
   - Configuring AWS credentials
   - Replacing the multer storage configuration
   - Documents would then be accessible via S3 URLs

4. **Permissions**: The permission system uses the existing middleware from `src/middleware/auth.ts`. You may need to add the new permissions to your permission management system:
   - `employee:read`
   - `employee:create`
   - `employee:update`
   - `employee:delete`

5. **Department Head**: A department can have a head (reference to Employee), creating a special employee-department relationship.

## Environment Variables

No new environment variables required. The system uses existing configurations:
- Database connection (MongoDB)
- JWT secret for authentication
- Existing CORS and security settings

---

## Dependencies Used

All dependencies are already in the project:
- `express` - Web framework
- `mongoose` - MongoDB ODM
- `bcryptjs` - Password hashing
- `multer` - File upload handling
- `express-validator` - Input validation
- `jsonwebtoken` - JWT authentication (via existing middleware)

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **S3 Integration**: Move document storage to AWS S3
2. **Email Notifications**: Send email when employee is created/updated
3. **Performance Reviews**: Add performance review tracking
4. **Leave Management**: Track employee leaves
5. **Attendance System**: Track employee attendance
6. **Salary Management**: Add salary and payroll information
7. **Document Expiry**: Track document expiry dates (e.g., for certifications)
8. **Employee Dashboard**: Create dedicated frontend views
9. **Bulk Import**: Import employees from Excel/CSV
10. **Audit Logs**: Track all changes to employee records
